It's down to this
I've got to make this life make sense
Can anyone tell what I've done
I missed life
I missed the colours of the world
Can anyone tell where I am
||
I took a walk around the world
To ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere
In the sands of time
But I watched the world float
To the dark side of the moon
I feel there is nothing I can do
||
Back in black
I hit the sack
I've been too long I'm glad to be back
Yes I'm, let loose
From the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I keep looking at the sky
'Cause it's gettin' me high
Forget the herse 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives
Cat's eyes
Usin' every one of them and running wild
||
Living easy, living free
Season ticket on a one-way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I would rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too
I'm on the highway to hell
No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me round
Hey Satan, payed my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey Momma, look at me
I'm on my way to the promised land
I'm on the highway to hell
(Don't stop me)
And I'm going down, all the way down
I'm on the highway to hell
||
Every time that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by, like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay
||
Every time that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by, like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay
||
There's a backseat lover,
That's always undercover
And I talked till my daddy say,
Said "ya ain't seen nothin till your down on a muffin,
And theres sure to be a change in way"
Now theres a cheerleader, that's a real big pleaser
As far as I could reminice
And the best thing lovin' was you sister and your cousin
And it started with a little kiss, like this
||
[Verse:]
I keep on fallin'... In--- and out of love with you
Sometimes I love ya, sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good, At times I feel used
Lovin' you darlin', makes me so confused
||
Aight, this is how we gon' do it, come on, uh
Birth, she here on the planet Earth
Against the curse of grain and submitted brain
Trained to submit the corporate reign
Radiation range, generation pain, fear
Migraines created by megabytes
Immune the night, every flight, it ain't right (it ain't right)
Uh, to the vast alone, the world shook up the ozone
In a world within a world (shake it down now)
The universe with new universes within
A world within a world saving the world from danger
In the realm of darkness, saved by Dark Angel

Who am I, an angel sent from above
Showing no love to thugs that rub me the wrong way
Nothing but cold nights and long days
When the woman ain't got nothing on me
Put a thin smile, criminal, post up cause it's about to get lonely
Queen of the underworld, you let it be ?
You come here, you better be ready to stoppin' our fear
Long after you're put to rest I'll still be here
Fightin' for those in despair, Dark Angel
Can't stop it, catastrophic prophet
Bankrupt to the prophets, erupted volcanic rockets
Fibre optics use backers, reform the hackers
Reserve, real world slacker, she burn baby burns
So we can learn, crazy learnin'
Access codes, blasts to overloads
Seen the old ways explode, saved by Dark Angel
The science, robot alliance
Comes in all shapes, with fairly new apes takes for granted
God planet, dangling rage, got a train against the grain
Throwing mama's pain off the train, talking heads
Talking heads, walking dead, some living to die
Some fighting the power, some living a lie
Keeping the truth from the vocal booth
Hoping you cool, big brother scoping you
Ready to get hi-tech and dissect your brain
Then your chest and open you
Knowing a few will only make the grade
Dark Angel, from who you should be afraid
||
Fuse is lit
Now the fuse is lit
(Now) The art, the art
(Now) The noise, the noise
(Now) The sound, the sound
||
Lived through you,
Safe with how we lived our lives,
With how it all turned out.
(But things are bound to change)
Uncovered lies, surfaced throughout,
Will make you change your mind
||
Somewhere life is good, and things go as they should
It's hard to find, but that's alright yeah
Searching for the way, push harder everyday
It's deep inside, that shining light yeah
But I'm scarred, by barriers placed in my path
I'm scathed
||
Culture was the seed of proliferation but it's gotten melded
Into an inharmonic whole, to an inharmonic whole.
Consciousness has plagued us and we cannot shake it
Though we think we're in control, though we think we're in control.
Questions that besiege us in life are testament of our helplessness.
||
Shut off the T. V. And peel off those sunday gloves, and i'll stain the
Clean that you've been counting, old mr. Fletcher passed by here
Today, after 40 years of toil he just stood up and walked away,
Fantastic the panic that showed in his eyes, he shrugged when I asked
Him about it, he said "young man pay heed, you listen well to what I
Say, now there comes a time for a man to walk away", walk away, i'll
Be a parade, and i'll be determined that no one shall dissuade on my
Way, i'll sure take some time to burn all the bridges that I'm leaving
Behind, he passed by again and he was shivering from the cold, I'm not
Sure but I think that he was trying, he told me about the weather and
Something old to pay, "but tomorrow", he said, "i'm gonna surely walk away"
||
Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there
She would merengue and do the cha-cha
And while she tried to be a star
Tony always tended bar
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4
They were young and they had each other
Who could ask for more?
||
We come on the sloop john b
My grandfather and me
Around nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night
Got into a fight
Well I feel so broke up
I want to go home
||
I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her
||
You tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me, you don't get me
||
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key.
||
Hey jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.
||
If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand?
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands
If I give my heart to you,
I must be sure
From the very start
That you,
Would love me more than her
If I trust in you oh please,
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her,
'cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I,
Would be sad if our new love,
Was in vain
So I hope you see that I,
Would love to love you,
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two.
If I fell in love with you
||
Michelle, my belle.
These are words that go together well,
My Michelle.
||
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk,
I'm a woman's man: no time to talk.
Music loud and women warm, I've been kicked around
Since I was born.
And now it's all right. It's ok.
And you may look the other way.
We can try to understand
The new york times effect on man.
||
Hey little sister what have you done,
Hey little sister who's the only one,
Hey little sister who's your superman,
Hey little sister who's the one you want,
Hey little sister shot gun!
||
In every heart there is a room
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along
||
Need more friends with wings,
All the angels I know put concrete in my veins
I'd always walk home alone,
So I became lifeless just like my telephone
||
Don't wait for, a knight in shining armor
Your savior's, reflected in the mirror
These flowers, have grown from bloodstains on the ground
Go rake them, leaves off your grass and my grave
The fact is, everyone bleeds when they shave
There's no use, so don't deny we're just the same
||
I am Iron Man!
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?
||
Some people say my love cannot be true
Please believe me my love and I'll show you
I will give you those things you thought unreal
The sun the moon the stars all bear my seal
||
Take me through the centuries to supersonic years
Electrifying enemy is drowning in his tears
All I have to give you is a love that never dies
The symptom of the universe is written in your eyes
||
I took her out, it was a friday night
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the tv
||
Once I had a love and it was a gas, soon turned out
Had a heart of glass.
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust.
Love's gone behind.
||
With a purposeful grimace and a terrible sound
He pulls the spitting high-tension wires down
||
Whoohoo!
Whoohoo!
Whoohoo!
Whoohoo!
||
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
||
Ooh, yeah; well, alright
We're jammin'
I wanna jam it with you
We're jammin', jammin'
And I hope you like jammin' too
Ain't no rules, ain't no vow
We can do it anyhow
I and I will see you through
'Cause every day we pay the price
We are the living sacrifice
Jammin' till the jam is through
||
Just take those old records off the shelf
I'll sit and listen to 'em by m'self
Today's music ain't got the same soul
I like that old time rock and roll
||
Hello again, it's you and me
Kinda always like it used to be
Sippin' wine, killin' time
Tryin' to solve life's mysteries
||
(Turn around) every now and then I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming round
(Turn around) every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears
(Turn around) every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by
(Turn around) every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes
||
I looked out this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away
||
If a picture paints a thousand words,
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show the you I've come to know.
If a face could launch a thousand ships,
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you,
You're all that's left me too.
And when my love for life is running dry,
You come and pour yourself on me.
||
Baby, can't you see
I'm calling
A guy like you
Should wear a warning
It's dangerous
I'm falling

Hold me close and tell me how you feel
Tell me love in real, ummmm, ummmm
Darling I love you, ummmm, uummmm
Instrumental
Words of love you whisper soft and true
||
Earth!
Fire!
Wind!
Water!
Heart!

Go planet!

By your powers combined, I am Captain Planet!

Captain Planet, he's our hero,
Gonna take pollution down to zero,
He's our powers magnified,
And he's fighting on the planet's side

Captain Planet, he's our hero,
Gonna take pollution down to zero,
Gonna help him put asunder,
Bad guys who like to loot and plunder

"You'll pay for this Captain Planet!"

(chanting)
We're the Planeteers,
You can be one too!
'Cause saving our planet is the thing to do,
Looting and polluting is not the way,
Hear what Captain Planet has to say:

"THE POWER IS YOURS!!"
||
Who's gonna tell you when,
It's too late,
Who's gonna tell you things,
Aren't so great.
||
Morning has broken, like the first morning.
Blackbird has spoken, like the first bird.
Praise for the singing, praise for the morning,
Praise for them springing fresh from the Word.
||
Making your way in the world today
Takes everything you've got
(Oi, oi, oi)
Taking a break from all your troubles
Sure would help a lot
||
Now the king told the boogie men
You have to let that raga drop
The oil down the desert way
Has been shakin' to the top
The sheik he drove his Cadillac
He went a-cruisin' down the ville
The muezzin was a' standing
On the radiator grille
||
You could have been all I wanted
But you weren't honest
Now get in the ground
You choked off the short list of favors
But if you really loved me
You would have endured my will
||
How long before I get in?
Before it starts, before I begin?
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like?
Where To, where do I go?
If you never try, then you'll never know.
How long do I have to climb,
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?
||
I've waited hours for this
I've made myself so sick
I wish I'd stayed
Asleep today
||
Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,
And think of you
Caught up in circles confusion
Is nothing new
Flashback warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcases of memories,
Time after
||
[Verse:]
Where is the moment when we needed the most
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skys fade to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Verse 2:]
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Chorus:]
Cause you had a bad day
You're taking it down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

[Verse 3:]
Will you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Chorus:]
You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
(Oh... Holiday...)

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong
And I'm dead wrong

So where is the passion when you need it the most
Oh you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

[Chorus:]
Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Had a bad day
Had a bad day
Had a bad day
Had a bad day
Had a bad day

Well she's a tongue twisting storm, she will come to the
Show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money she's a funky-thigh
Collector
Layin' on 'lectric dreams
||
Out of touch out of reach yeah
You could try to get closer to me
I'm in love I'm in deep yeah
Hypnotized I'm shakin' to my knees
||
(Part I)
I know you think that I shouldn't still love you
Or tell you that
But if I didn't say it
Well, I'd still have felt it
Where's the sense in that?
||
Ich wrde dir gern sagen
Wie sehr ich dich mag
Warum ich nur noch an dich denken kann.
Ich fhl mich wie verhext und ih Gefangenschaft
Und du allein trgst Schuld daran
Worte sind dafr zu schwach
Ich befrchte, du glaubst mir nicht.
Mir kommt es vor, als ob mich jemand warnt,
Dieses Mrchen wird nicht gut ausgehen.
Es ist die Eifersucht, die mich auffrisst,
Immer dann, wenn du nicht in meiner Nhe bist.
Von Dr. Jekyll werd' ich zu Mr. Hyde,
Ich kann nichts dagegen tun, pltzlich ist es soweit.
Ich bin kurz davor, durchzudrehen,
Aus Angst, dich zu verlieren.
Und das uns jetzt kein Unglck geschieht,
Dafr kann ich nicht garantieren.
Chorus:
Und alles nur,
Weil ich dich liebe.
Und ich nicht wei wie ichs beweisen soll.
Komm ich zeig dir wie gro meine Liebe ist
Und bringe mich fr dich um.
Sobald deine Laune etwas schlechter ist
Bild' ich mir gleich ein, dass du mich nicht mehr willst.
Ich sterbe beim Gedanken daran,
Dass ich dich nicht fr lnger halten kann.
Auf einmal brennt ein Feuer in mir
Und der Rest der Welt wird schwarz.
Ich spr wie unsere Zeit verinnt.
Wi nhern uns dem letzten Akt.
Chorus:
Und alles nur,
Weil ich dich liebe.
Und ich nicht wei wie ichs beweisen soll.
Komm ich zeig dir wie gro meine Liebe ist
Und bringe mich fr dich um.
Ich bin kurz davor, durchzudrehen,
Aus Angst dich zu verlieren
Und das uns jetzt kein Unglck geschieht,
Dafr kann ich nicht garantieren.
Chorus:
Und alles nur,
Weil ich dich liebe.
Und ich nicht wei wie ichs beweisen soll.
Komm ich zeig dir wie gro meine Liebe ist
Und bringe mich fr dich um.
Komm ich zeig dir wie gro meine Liebe ist,
Und bringe you

Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh Yeah the boy can play
Dedication devotion
Turning all the night time into the day
||
Mary Ann and Wanda were the best of friends
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H club
Both active in the ffa
After graduation Mary Ann went out lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town and all she found was Earl
||
You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
||
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out alone
Riders on the storm
||
We come from...
Over the dark horizon sky
With twisted tales of sacrifice
To imagine or believe all the glory of the free
||
Life is a misery, don't know how it's come to be
Death, the epitome of all of our days
In the past we had no choice to hear or to be the voice
Close your eyes and visualise, the demon to arise
||
On a cold winter morning, in a time before the light
In flames of death's eternal reign we ride towards the fight
When the darkness has fallen down and the times are tough alright
The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight
||
Headline: "Murder, young girl killed
Desperate shooting at Echo's Hill
Dreadful ending, killer died
Evidently suicide. "
||
Subconscious Strange Sensation
Unconscious relaxation
What a pleasant nightmare
And I can't wait to get there again
||
All your eyes have ever seen
All you've ever heard
Is etched upon my memory
I spoken through my words
||
Napalm showers
Showed the cowards
We weren't there to mess around
||
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
You been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow
Don' you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of heats is always your best bet
Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get
Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no youger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walking through this world all alone
Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're loosin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you, before it's too late
||
Got a surprise especially for you,
Something that both of us have always wanted to do.
We've waited so long, waited so long.
We've waited so long, waited so long.
||
Levon wears his war wound like a crown
He calls his child Jesus
'Cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town
||
Blue jean baby, L. A. Lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand
||
A well I bless my soul
What's wrong with me?
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
||
That's not the beginning of the end
That's the return to yourself
The return to innocence.
||
... Eurus...
... Afer Ventus...
... So the world goes round and round
With all you ever knew --
They say the sky high above
Is Caribbean blue...
||
One look at love and you may see
It weaves a web over mystery,
All ravelled threads can rend apart
For hope has a place in the lover's heart.
Hope has a place in a lover's heart.
||
If you wanna hang out youve got to take her out; cocaine.
If you wanna get down, down on the ground; cocaine.
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie; cocaine.
||
Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would you feel the same
If I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven...
||
We're leaving together
But still it's farewell
And maybe we'll come back,
To earth, who can tell?
||
Playground school bell rings again.
Rain clouds come to play again.
Has no one told you she's not breathing?
Hello, I'm your mind giving you
Someone to talk to.
Hello.
||
I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone
||
Weve come a long long way together,
Through the hard times and the good,
I have have to celebrate you baby,
I have to praise you like I should
||
Alone for a while I've been searching through the dark,
For traces of the love you left inside my lonely heart.
To weave by picking up the pieces that remain.
Melodies of Life - Love's lost refrain.
||
I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
||
Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?
||
Dance your cares away
Worry's for another day
Let the music play
Down at Fraggle Rock
Work your cares away
Dancing's for another day
Let the Fraggles play
We're Gobo  Mokey  Wembley  Boober  Red
Dance your cares away
Worry's for another day
Let the music play
Down at Fraggle Rock
||
She calls me from the cold
Just when I was low,
Feeling short of stable
||
Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart
||
All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
||
Ghostbusters...
If there's somethin' strange in your neighborhood
Who ya gonna call (ghostbusters)
If it's somethin' weird an it won't look good
Who ya gonna call (ghostbusters)
||
I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place.
Even your emotions had an echo
In so much space
||
I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snake bite into my veins
Never did I wanna be here again
And I don't remember why I came
||
And I'd give up forever to touch you,
Cause I know that you feel me somehow.
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be,
And I don't want to go home right now.
||
And even though the moment passed me by
I still can't turn away
Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose
Got tossed along the way
And letters that you never meant to send
Get lost or thrown away
||
Long distance runner, what you standin there for?
Get up, get out, get out of the door
Your playin cold music on the barroom floor
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core.
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down.
||
I lit out from reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep last night till the morning came around.
||
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time
||
Lonely feelin' deep inside
Find a corner where I can hide
Silent footsteps crowdin' me
Sudden darkness, but I can see
||
When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin' when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
We've been through this
Such a long long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain
Yeahh..
But lovers always come
And lovers always go
And no one's really sure
Who's lettin' go today
Walking away
If we could take the time
To lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me
Then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain
||
She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I'd stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry
||
What is love
Oh baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
Oh, baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
||
The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling that's the power of love
||
(In a low voice)
Woe to you o earth and sea
For the devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows that time is short
Let him who hath understanding recon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
It's number is six hundred and sixty six
||
(In a low voice)
Woe to you o earth and sea
For the devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows that time is short
Let him who hath understanding recon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
It's number is six hundred and sixty six

There are children standing here,
Arms outstretched into the sky,
Tears drying on their face.
He has been here.
Brothers lie in shallow graves.
Fathers lost without a trace.
A nation blind to their disgrace,
Since he's been here.
||
Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Susanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
||
A promise or a dare
I would jump if I knew you'd catch me
Staring over the edge
I can't tell if you'll be here for me
||
You took your coat off and stood in the rain,
You're always crazy like that.
And I watched from my window,
Always felt I was outside looking in on you.
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair,
You were fashionably sensitive
But too cool to care.
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather.
||
Operator
Oh, could you help me place this call?
You see the number on the matchbook
Is old and faded
||
Hey Joe, a-where you goin' with that gun in your hand
Hey Joe, I said where you goin' with that gun in your hand, oh yeah

Verse:
If God had a name, what would it be
And would you call it to His face
If you were faced with Him in all His glory
What would you ask if you had just one question
||
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today...

Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today...

An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw
||
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
||
I am a king of honor
Gold and glory
But every king must also die
Have I been just and righteous
What is glory
I know I've torn and taken life
And here I stand
A small and simple man
||
I close my eyes, only for a moment, and the moment's gone
All my dreams, pass before my eyes, a curiosity
Dust in the wind, all they are is dust in the wind

Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea
All we do, crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see
Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind.
Oh________________

Now, Don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips away, all your money won't another minute buy

Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind
Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind
Dust in the wind, everything is dust in the wind (everything is dust in the wind)
||
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch
I would know
||
I lay, looking at my hands
I search in these lines
I've not the answer
I'm crying and I don't know
Watching the sky
I search for an answer
I'm free, free to be
I'm not another liar
I just want to be myself...myself

[Marius goes into the garden, leaving Eponine outside.]
Marius
A heart full of love
A heart full of song
I'm doing everything all wrong
Oh God, for shame
I do not even know your name
Dear Mad'moiselle
Won't you say?
Will you tell?
Cosette
A heart full of love
No fear, no regret
Marius
My name is Marius Pontmercy
Cosette
And mine's Cosette
Marius
Cosette, I don't know what to say
Cosette
Then make no sound
Marius
I am lost
Cosette
I am found!
Marius
A heart full of light
Cosette
A night bright as day
Marius
And you must never go away
Cosette, Cosette
Cosette
This is a chain we'll never break
Marius
Do I dream?
Cosette
I'm awake!
Marius                             Eponine [outside, interjecting]
A heart full of love               He was never mine to lose
Cosette
A heart full of you                Why regret what could not be?
Marius
A single look and then I knew.     These are words he'll never say
Cosette
I knew it too.                     Not to me...
Marius
From today...                      Not to me...
Cosette
Every day                          Not for me...
Cosette & Marius
For it isn't a dream               His heart full of love
Not a dream                        He will never
After all!                         Feel this way...

You wanted power and you begged for fame
You wanted everything the easy way
You wanted gain without pain
Now your bill is in the mail
You got stronger but your mind got weak
You made a promise that you couldn't keep
You had it all - You lost more
It's all there in the fee
||
I see trees of green........ Red roses too
I see em bloom..... For me and for you
And I think to myself.... What a wonderful world.

I see skies of blue..... Clouds of white
Bright blessed days.... Dark sacred nights
And I think to myself..... What a wonderful world.

The colors of a rainbow..... So pretty.. In the sky
Are also on the faces..... Of people.. Going by
I see friends shaking hands..... Sayin.. How do you do
They're really sayin...... I love you.

I hear babies cry...... I watch them grow
They'll learn much more..... Than I'll never know
And I think to myself..... What a wonderful 

The colors of a rainbow..... So pretty.. In the sky

A whole lot more than I'll never know)

Yes I think to myself....... What a wonderful world.

(Verse 1)
There's a hero if you look inside your heart,
You don't have to be afraid of what you are.
And There's an answer, if you reach into your soul,
And the sorrow that you know will melt away.

Tonto el que no entienda
Cuenta una leyenda
Que una hembra gitana
Conjuro a la Luna hasta el amanecer
Llorando pedнa
Al llegar el dнa
Desposar un calй
||
You take a mortal man,
And put him in control
Watch him become a god,
Watch peoples heads a'roll
A'roll...
||
I can only imagine what it will be like, when I walk by Your side...
I can only imagine, what my eyes will see, when Your Face is before me!
I can only imagine. I can only imagine.
Surrounded by Your Glory, what will my heart feel?
Will I dance for you, Jesus? Or in awe of You, be still?
Will I stand in Your presence, or to my knees will I fall?
Will I sing 'Hallelujah! '? Will I be able to speak at all?
I can only imagine! I can only imagine!
||
[Verse 1]
Life, it seems will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free !!!

[Verse 2]
Things are not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this Hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me but now he's gone !!!

[Guitar Bridge]

[Bridge]
No one but me can save myself
But it's too late
Now I can't think
Think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm
Now I will just say Goodbye ...
Goodbye !!!
||
End of passion play
Crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
||
[Verse 1]
So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the Heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

[Verse 2]
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

[Pre-Chorus]
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

[Verse 1]
So close no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the Heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

[Pre-Chorus]
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the Heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters ...
||
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
||
Hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who takes you there
Hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who cares
They
They betray
I'm your only true friend now
They
They'll betray
I'm forever there
I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true
I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true
You
You're my mask
You're my cover, my shelter
You
You're my mask
You're the one who's blamed
Do
Do my work
Do my dirty work, scapegoat
Do
Do my deeds
For you're the one who's shamed
I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true
I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true
Hate
I'm your hate
I'm your hate when you want love
Pay
Pay the price
Pay, for nothing's fair
Hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who took you here
Hey
I'm your life
And I no longer care
I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true
I'm your truth, telling lies
I'm your reasoned alibis
I'm inside
Open your eyes
I'm you
Sad but true
||
[Verse 1]
All that is, was and will be
Universe, much too big to see
Time and space, never ending
Disturbing thoughts, questions pending
Limitations of human understanding
Too quick to criticize
Obligation to survive
We hunger to be alive, yeah

[Chorus]
(Twisting, turning through the never)
All that is, ever, ever was
Will be ever, twisting, turning
Through the never

[Verse 2]
In the dark, see past our eyes
Pursuit of truth no matter where it lies
Gazing up to the breeze of the Heavens
On a quest, meaning, reason
Came to be, how it begun
All alone in the family of the Sun
Curiosity teasing everyone
On our home, third stone from the Sun, yeah

[Chorus]
(Twisting, turning through the never)
All that is, ever, ever was
Will be ever, twisting, turning
Through the never

[Solo]

[Bridge]
On through the never
We must go
On through the never
Out to the
Edge of forever
We must go
On through the never
Then ever comes

[Chorus]
(Twisting, turning through the never)
All that is, ever, ever was
Will be ever, twisting, turning
Who we are, ask forever
Twisting, turning through the never
Never !!!
||
[Verse 1]
Welcome to where Time stands still
No One leaves and No One will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled Mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every Night
I see our Freedom in my Sight
No locked Doors, no windows Barred
No things to make my Brain seem Scarred

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sleep my friend and you will See
That Dream is my Reality
They keep me Locked up in this Cage
Can't they see it's why my brains says "Rage?"

[Chorus]
Sanitarium, leave me Be
Sanitarium, just leave me Alone

[Verse 2]
Build my Fear of what's out there
And cannot Breathe the open Air
Whisper things into my Brain
Assuring me that I'm Insane
They think our Heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent Plans
Keep him Tied, it makes Him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No more can they keep Us in
Listen, damn it, we will Win
They see it right, they see it Well
But they think this saves us from our Hell

[Chorus]
Sanitarium, leave me Be
Sanitarium, just leave me Alone

[Bridge]
Sanitarium
(Just leave me alone)

[Outro]
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the Air
Got some Death to do
Mirror stares back Hard
Kill, it's such a friendly Word
Seems the only Way
For reaching out Again
||
I can't believe it's over
I watched the whole thing fall
And I never saw the writing that was on the wall
If I only knew
The days were slipping past
That the good things never last
That you were cryin'
||
I Took My Baby
On A Saturday Bang
Boy Is That Girl With You
Yes We're One And The Same
||
I got something to say
I killed your baby today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as it's dead
||
Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear
And curse
When you're chewing on
Life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best...
And...
||
Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh
Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh
||
I thought I saw a man brought to life
He was warm, he came around like
He was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry
Well you couldn't be that man I adored
You don't seem to know, don't seem to care
What your heart is for
No I don't know him anymore
||
She was morning
And I was night time
I one day woke up
To find her lying
Beside my bed
I softly said
"Come take me"
For I've been lonely
In need of someone
As though I'd done
Someone wrong somewhere
I don't know where
Come lately
||
I want to live,
I want to give
I've been a miner
For a heart of gold.
It's these expressions
I never give
That keep me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old.
Keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old.
||
Old man look at my life,
I'm a lot like you were.
Old man look at my life,
I'm a lot like you were.
||
This time, This place
Misused, Mistakes
Too long, Too late
Who was I to make you wait?
Just one chance
Just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know, you know, you know I love you
||
Sister Christian, oh the time has come
And you know that you're the only one to say
Okay
||
Come
As you are
As you were
As I want you to be
As a friend
As a friend
As an old enemy
Take your time
Hurry up
The choice is your
Don't be late
Take a rest
As a friend
As an old memoria
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria
||
I'm so happy 'cause today I found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly but that's ok, 'cause so are you
We've broke our mirrors
Sunday morning is everyday for all I care
I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze 'cause I've found god
||
Many a hand has scaled the grand old face of the plateau
Some belong to strangers and some to folks you know
Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand
To beautify the foothills and shake the many hands
||
Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's overbored and self-assured
Oh, no, I know a dirty word
||
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
||
1-2 fuck off, drop out, never trust a fucking hippie
And for that matter don't trust anyone.
Quit school, don't work, livin' out the music de punk.
If I could do it so could anyone.
||
Talking about the Moron Bros', tattooed fingers, tattooed toes
They're idiots, losers, they're scum
Taking advantage of everyone
You're a dog, they're your fleas
Doing everything they can to spread disease

How many special people change?
How many lives are living strange?
Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova in the sky
Wake up the dawn and ask her why
A dreamer dreams, she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova
'Cause we don't believe
That they're gonna get away from the summer
But you and I will never die
The world's still spinning around we don't know why
Why-why-why-why-i-i
(Guitar solo)
How many special people change?
How many lives are living strange?
Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova
'Cause we don't believe
That they're gonna get away from the summer
But you and I will never die
The world's still spinning around we don't know why
Why-why-why-why-i-i
(A really long guitar solo)
(Background - sounds like a bunch of "No"'s)
(Birds chirping)
(More guitar)
How many special people change?
How many lives are living strange?
Where were you while we were getting high?
We were getting high
||
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
||
I wrote her off for the tenth time today
I practiced all the things I would say
But she came over
I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her desserve
||
All aboard! Ha ha ha ha ha ha haaaa!

Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay

Crazy, but that's how it goes
Millions of people living as foes
Maybe it's not too late
To learn how to love
And forget how to hate

Mental wounds not healing
Life's a bitter shame
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train

Let's Go!

I've listened to preachers
I've listened to fools 
I've watched all the dropouts
Who make their own rules
One person conditioned to rule and control
The media sells it and you live the role

Mental wounds still screaming
Driving me insane
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train

I know that things are going wrong for me
You gotta listen to my words
Yeah

Heirs of a cold war
That's what we've become
Inheriting troubles I'm mentally numb
Crazy, I just cannot bear
I'm living with something' that just isn't fair

Mental wounds not healing
Who and what's to blame
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train

O. Osbourne/M. Hudson/S. Dudas
There is person living in my head
She comes to visit every night in bed
I fight the demon, but it just won't fall
The voices in my dungeon starting to call
The spiders dancing on the wall
Suicide of love we could have had it all
And it is you, you are the ghost behind my eyes
The ghost that tells me lies
The princess of the dark has made my mind home
My haunted head and her won't leave me alone
She dances on my heart with fire in my soul
I hate that feeling when I'm loosing control
The spiders dancing on the wall
Suicide of love we could have had it all
And it is you, you are the ghost behind my eyes
The ghost that tells me lies
I wish to god that I could sleep
Again, oh peace again
And wake up from this nightmare
Free again
Free again, oh me again
There is a woman in my head
She comes to visit every night in bed
The spiders dancing on the wall
Suicide of love we could have had it all
And it is you, you are the ghost behind my eyes
You, you are the ghost behind my eyes
You, you are the ghost behind my eyes
Behind my eyes
The ghost behind my eyes
||
Out on the street I'm stalking the night
I can hear my heavy breathing
Paid for the kill but it doesn't seem right
Something there I can't believe in
||
Cut my life into pieces
This is my last resort
Suffocation
No breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
||
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time, hung me on A line
Maybe I'm afraid at the way you really love me
||
You guys ready...
Alone... Listless... Breakfast table in an otherwise empty room
Young girl... Violence... Center of her own attention
Mother reads aloud, child tries to understand it
Tries to make her proud
The shades go down, it's in her head
Painted room... Can't deny there's something wrong...
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me...
She holds the hand that holds her down
She will... Rise above...
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to be
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me...
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to be
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me...
The shades go down
The shades go down
The shades go, go, go...

Hello,
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
||
Hey you! Out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me
Hey you! Standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles, can you feel me
Hey you! Don't help them to bury the live
Don't give in without a fight.
Hey you! Out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone would you touch me
Hey you! With your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out would you touch me
Hey you! Would you help me to carry the stone
Open your heart, I'm coming home
But it was only a fantasy
The wall was too high as you can see
No matter how he tried he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain.
Hey you! Out there on the road
Always doing what you're told, can you help me
Hey you! Out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall, can you help me
Hey you! Don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall.
||
Money, get away
Get a good job with more pay
And your O. K.
||
Run, run, run, run [repeat line four times]
You better make your face up in
Your favourite disguise
With your button down lips and your
Roller blind eyes
With your empty smile
And your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters
When the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter
Down the door
You better run
||
Ooooh you cannot reach me now
Ooooh no matter how you try
Goodbye cruel world it's over
Walk on by
Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come
In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come
Waiting to cut out the deadwood
Waiting to clean up the city
Waiting to follow the worms
Waiting to put on a black shirt
Waiting to weed out the weaklings
Waiting to smash in their windows
And kick in their doors
Waiting for the final solution
To strengthen the strain
Waiting to follow the worms
Waiting to turn on the showers v And fire the ovens
Waiting for the queers and the coons
And the reds and the Jews
Waiting to follow the worms
Would you like to see Britannia
Rule again my friend
All you have to do is follow the worms
Would you like to send our coloured cousins
Home again my friend
All you need to do is follow the worms.
||
So,
So you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell?
Blue skies from pain?
||
I met my love by the gas works wall
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
I kissed my girl by the factory wall
Dirty old town
Dirty old town
Clouds a drifting across the moon
Cats a prowling on their beat
Spring's a girl in the street at night
Dirty old town
Dirty old town
Heard a siren from the docks
Saw a train set the night on fire
Smelled the spring on the smokey wind
Dirty old town
Dirty old town
I'm going to make a good sharp axe
Shining steel tempered in the fire
Will chop you down like an old dead tree
Dirty old town
Dirty old town
(Ewan Mccoll)
Song: Jesse James
Jesse James we understand
Has killed many a man
He robbed the Union trains
He stole from the rich and gave to the poor
He'd a hand and a heart and a brain
Well it was on a Saturday night
The stars were shining bright
They robbed the Glendale train
And the people they did say for many miles away
It was those outlaws Frank and Jesse James
Now Jesse had a wife
Lived a lady all her life
Her children they were brave
But history does record
That Bob and Charlie Ford
Have laid poor Jesse in his grave
Well it was Bob and Charlie Ford
Those dirty little cowards
I wonder how they feel
For they ate of Jesse's bread and they slept in Jesse's bed
And they laid poor Jesse in his grave
Now Jesse had a wife
Lived a lady all her life
Her children they were brave
But history does record
That Bob and Charlie Ford
Have laid poor Jesse in his grave
Well the people held their breath
When they heard of Jesse's death
They wondered how he came to fall
Well it was Robert Ford in fact who shot him in the back
While he hung a picture on the wall
Now Jesse had a wife
Lived a lady all her life
Her children they were brave
But history does record
That Bob and Charlie Ford
Have laid poor Jesse in his grave

Every breath you take and every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take, I'll be watching you
Every single day and every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay, I'll be watching you
Oh can't you see you belong to me?
How my poor heart aches with every step you take
Every move you make and every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake, I'll be watching you
Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night
I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby please
||
You consider me the young apprentice
Caught between the scylla and charibdes
Hypnotized by you if I should linger
Staring at the ring around your finger
||
Well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you, (who?)
If I get drunk, (If I get drunk, ) well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you, (yeah) Yes! 
And if I haver, (when I hav... What does haver mean, ) 
Yeah I know I'm gonna be I'm gonna be the man who's havering to you, (It's on 'ere)
||
Everything's so blurry
And everyone's so fake
And everybody's empty
And everything is so messed up
Pre-occupied without you
I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you
I stumble then I crawl
||
Met a girl, thought she was grand
Fell in love found out first hand
Went well for a week or two
Then it all came unglued
||
Open up your mind and let me step inside
Rest your weary head and let your heart decide
It's so easy when you know the rules
It's so easy all you have to do
Is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love, yeah
||
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
||
When you were here before,
Couldn't look you in the eye,
You're just like an angel,
Your skin makes me cry;

You float like a feather,
In a beautiful world,
I wish I was special,
You're so very special;

But I'm a creep,
I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here;

I don't care if it hurts,
I wanna have control,
I want a perfect body,
I want a perfect soul;

I want you to notice,
When I'm not around,
You're so very special,
I wish I was special;

But I'm a creep,
I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here, ohhhh, ohhhh

She's running out again,
She's running,
She runs runs runs runs...
Runs...

Whatever makes you happy,
Whatever you want,
You're so fucking special,
I wish I was special;

But I'm a creep,
I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here,

I don't belong here...

Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through (the whole day through)
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind (Georgia on my mind)
I said a Georgia, Georgia
A song of you (a song of you)
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in the peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
I said Georgia, oh Georgia, no peace I find (no peace I find)
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind (Georgia on my mind oh)
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
Oh Georgia,
No peace, no peace I find
Just an old, sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind (Georgia on my mind)
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
Oh Georgia, Georgia
No peace, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind (Georgia on my mind)
I said just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more.
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more. (What you say?)
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more.
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more.

Gone are the days, when I would go traveling
Over the sea, as a sailor
Seeking the breeze, my dreams went unraveling, 
Far from the memories on the shore
||
Ooh, Life is bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no I've said too much, I set it up.
||
Risin' up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
||
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no
||
Hey, uh huh huh
Hey, uh huh huh
||
Sunlight dances through the leaves
Soft winds stir the signing trees
Lying in the warm grass
Feel the sun upon your face
Elfin songs and endless nights
Sweet wine and soft relaxing lights
Time will never touch you
Here in this enchanted place
||
Oh maria maria
She reminds me of a west side story
Growing up in spanish harlem
She's living the life just like a movie star
||
She's taking her time making up the reasons
To justify all the hurt inside
Guess she knows from the smiles and the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one
They're saying, "Mama never loved her much."
And, "Daddy never keeps in touch.
That's why she shies away from human affection. "
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bag for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come
And she'll say to him,
She's sayin,
||
It's early morning
The sun comes out
Last night was shaking
And pretty loud
My cat is purring
And scratches my skin

Time, it needs time
To win back your love again.
I will be there, I will be there.

Love, only love
Can bring back your love someday.
I will be there, I will be there.

Fight, babe, I'll fight
To win back your love again.
I will be there, I will be there.

Love, only love
Can break down the walls someday.
I will be there, I will be there.

If we'd go again
All the way from the start,
I would try to change
The things that killed our love.

Your pride has build a wall, so strong
That I can't get through.
Is there really no chance
To start once again?
I'm loving you.

Try, baby try
To trust in my love again.
I will be there, I will be there.

Love, our love
Just shouldn't be thrown away.
I will be there, I will be there.

If we'd go again
All the way from the start,
I would try to change
The things that killed our love.

Your pride has build a wall, so strong
That I can't get through.
Is there really no chance
To start once again?

If we'd go again
All the way from the start,
I would try to change
The things that killed our love.

Yes I've hurt your pride, and I know
What you've been through.
You should give me a chance
This can't be the end.

I'm still loving you.
I'm still loving you,
I need your love.
I'm still loving you.
Still loving you, baby...

Sunny day
Sweeping the clouds away
On my way to where the air is sweet
Can you tell me how to get
How to get to sesame street

Come and play everything's a-okay
Friendly neighbors yes that's where we meet
Can you tell me how to get how to get to sesame street

It's a magic carpet ride
Every door is open wide
||
Tell me lies
Slap me on the face
Just improvise
Do something
Really clever
That'll make me hate
Your name forever

They Fight, and Bite
They Fight and Fight and Bite

Ricky was a young boy, He had a heart of stone.
Lived 9 to 5 and worked his fingers to the bone.
Just barely got out of school, came from the edge of town.
Fought like a switchblade so no one could take him down.
He had no money, oooh no good at home.
He walked the streets a soldier and he fought the world alone
And now it's
||
I lie here paralytic
Inside this soul
Screaming for you till my throat is numb
I wanna break out I need a way out
I don't believe that it's gotta be this way
The worst is the waiting
In this world I'm suffocating
||
You come to me with scars on your wrist
You tell me this will be the last night feeling like this
I just came to say goodbye
I didn't want you to see me cry, I'm fine
But I know it's a lie
||
I'll sing it one last time for you
Then we really have to go
You've been the only thing that's right
In all I've done
||
In my eyes,
Indisposed,
In disguise
As no one knows.
Hides the face,
Lies the snake,
And the sun
In my disgrace.
Boiling heat,
Summer stench.
'Neath the black
The sky looks dead.
Call my name
Through the cream,
And I'll hear you
Scream again.
||
Tomorrow morning if you wake up
And the sun does not appear,
I, I will be here.
If in the dark we lose sight of love
Hold my hand and have no fear,
'Cause I, I will be here.
||
All is fair in love
Love's a crazy game
Two people vow to stay
In love as one they say
But all is changed with time
The future no one can see
The road you leave behind
Ahead lies mystery
But all is fair in love
I had to go away
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair
||
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we walk in the fields of gold
||
Ich bin so wild nach deinem Erdbeermund,
Ich schrie mir schon die Lungen wund
Nach deinem weissen Leib, du Weib.
I'm Klee, da hat der Mai ein Bett gemacht,
Da blüht ein schöner Zeitvertreib
Mit deinem Leib die lange Nacht.
Da will ich sein I'm tiefen Tal
Dein Nachtgebet und auch dein Sterngemahl.

Ein gutes Mädchen lief einst fort,
Verliess der Kindheit schönen Ort;
Verliess die Eltern und sogar
Den Mann, dem sie versprochen war.
Vor einem Haus da blieb sie stehn,
Darinnen war ein Mann zu sehn
Der Bilder stach in nackte Haut,
Da rief das gute Mädchen laut:
||
Out the door just in time
Head down the 405
Gotta meet the new boss by eight am
||
Wake up (Wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
Hide the scars to fade away the shake up
(Hide the scars to fade away the shake)
Why'd you leave the keys up on the table?
Here you go create another fable
||
I-I-I-I-I-I
I came to dance-dance-dance-dance
I hit the floor cause that's my plans plans plans plans
I'm wearing all my favorite brands brands brands brands
Give me some space for both my hands hands hands hands.
Yeah, yeah.
Cause it goes on and on and on.
And it goes on and on and on.
Yeah.
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying ay-oh, gotta let go.
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying ay-oh, baby let's go.
Cause we gon' rock this club
We gon' go all night
We gon' light it up
Like it's dynamite.
Cause I told you once
Now I told you twice
We gon light it up

I came to move move move move
Get out the way me and my crew crew crew crew
I'm in the club so I'm gonna do do do do
Just what the fuck came here do do do do
Yeah, yeah
Cause it goes on and on and on.
And it goes on and on and on.

Cause I-I-I believe it
And I-I-I, I just want it all, I just want it all.
I'm gonna put my hands in the air
Ha-hands hands in the air
Put your hands in the air-air-air-air-air-air-air-air

Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you
Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature
Everybody wants to rule the world
||
I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's got to be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears
||
Well sometimes I go out by myself and I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing and in my head I make a picture
||
Long before the screen door slammed, she was out of xenia
A stranger could have loved that town but she had to leave
||
I'm holding on your rope,
Got me ten feet off the ground
I'm hearin what you say but I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say...
||
She grew up in an Indiana town
Had a good lookin' momma who never was around
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on an Indiana night
||
No me abandonas asн
Hablando sola de ti
Ven y devuйlveme al fin La sonrisa que se fue
Una vez mбs
Tocar tu piel y hondo suspirar
Recuperemos lo que se ha perdido.

Master Shamen
I have come
With my dolly from the shadow side
With a demon and an Englishman
I'm my mother
I'm my son
Nobody else is slipping the blade in easy
Nobody else is slipping the blade in the marmalade
||
In decadence I take thee by the hand
Too frail... To gain the promised land
Too frail... To take your pain away
Too frail... A sequel of decay
May milleniums gather
On the mirage of desolated souls
Far between departure and sorrow
I breed my afterthought
In thy hours of vast dejection's haunt... Wane
An angel strays upon my door
So frail and lost within
To weep upon her days of yore
My decadent come in
Her stain and tears upon my floor
The sorrow that she brings
Devotion of a life outworn
In decadence come in
May thy lids desorb from emerald seas
A pending solitary
Though thy pain redeems, life it seems to be
A fragile sanctuary
||
And so she woke up
Woke up from where she was
Lying still
Said I gotta do something
About where we're going
||
[Verse 1]
See the stone set in your eyes,
See the thorn twist in your side,
I wait for you.
Sleight of hand and twist of fate,
On a bed of nails she makes me wait,
And I wait, without you.

[Chorus]
With or without you,
With or without you

[Verse 2]
Through the storm we reach the shore,
You give it all but I want more,
And I'm waiting for you.
With or without you,
With or without you.
I can't live,
With or without you.

[Chorus]
And you give yourself away,
And you give yourself away,
And you give,
And you give,
And you give yourself away.

[Bridge]
My hands are tied,
My body bruised, she's got me with,
Nothing to win and
Nothing left to lose.

[Chorus]
And you give yourself away,
And you give yourself away,
And you give,
And you give,
And you give yourself away.
With or without you,
With or without you,
I can't live,
With or without you, oh

[Outro]
With or without you,
With or without you, oh,
I can't live,
With or without you,
With or without you.

I, hate the rain and sunny weather,
And I, I hate the beach and mountains too bu hu
And I don't like a thing about the city, no, no
And I, I, I, hate the countryside too!
||
Owwww!
I get up, and nothin' gets me down
You got it tough, I've seen the toughest around
And I know, baby, just how you feel
You got to roll with the punches and get to what's real
Ah, can't ya see me standin' here
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Ah, can't ya see what I mean?
Ah, might as well jump. Jump!
Might as well jump
Go ahead an' jump. Jump!
Go ahead and jump
Ow-oh! Hey, you! Who said that? Baby, how you been?
You say you don't know, you won't know until you begin
So can't ya see me standing here
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Ah, can't ya see what I mean?
Ah, might as well jump. Jump!
Go ahead and jump
Might as well jump. Jump!
Go ahead and jump
Jump!

Might as well jump. Jump!
Go ahead and jump
Get it in, jump. Jump!
Go ahead and jump
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

Don't wanna wait til tomorrow,
Why put it off another day?
One more walk through problems,
Built up, and stand in our way, ah
One step ahead, one step behind me
Now you gotta run to get even
Make future plans, don't dream about yesterday, hey
C'mon turn, turn this thing around
Right now, hey
It's your tomorrow
Right now,
C'mon, it's everything
Right now,
Catch a magic moment, do it
Right here and now
It means everything
Miss the beat, you lose the rhythm,
And nothing falls into place, no
Only missed by a fraction,
Slipped a little off your pace, oh,
The more things you get, the more you want,
Just trade in one for the other,
Workin so hard, to make it easier, whoa,
Got to turn, c'mon turn this thing around
Right now, hey
It's your tomorrow
Right now,
C'mon, it's everything
Right now,
Catch that magic moment, do it
Right here and now
It means everything
It's enlightened me, right now
What are you waitin for
Oh, yeah, right now

Right now, hey
It's your tomorrow
Right now,
C'mon, it's everything
Right now,
Catch that magic moment, and do it right,
Right now
Right now, oh, right now
It's what's happening?
Right here and now
Right now
It's right now
Oh,
Tell me, what are you waiting for
Turn this thing around

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise

Mary, did you know?
That your baby boy would one day walk on water?
Mary, did you know?
That your baby boy would save our sons and daughters?

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round 'yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in Heavenly peace
Sleep in Heavenly peace
||
So long ago, I don't remember when
That's when they say I lost my only friend
Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
As I listened through the cemetery trees
||
I believe the children are our future
Teach them well
And let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty
They possess inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be
||
What is the explanation? Who knows?
We will discover the truth, we will discover the truth
We will discover the truth, we will discover the truth
||
Blue eyed dressed for every situation
Moving through the doorway of a nation
Pick me up and shake the doubt
Baby I can't do without
||
If you play with fire you'll get burned
It's such a shame
Even when you try you'll never learn
To tame the flames
||
Take what you want, the you'll get what you need
Isn't that all that we're teaching
Slowly but surely we're planting the seed
Hey listen, there's no use in preaching
||
A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same
But all the miles that separate
Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face

El reloj
Ya marco medianoche
Y otra vez encontre
Que tan solo me acompana la TV

Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady

Cruised into a bar on the shore
Her picture on the door
She a long lost love at first bite
Baby, maybe you're wrong

Of our lives until somebody says
"Forgive me if I seem out of line"
Then she whipped out a gun
Tried to blow me away

They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging hot spot
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop

She's a cranky old critter
She's bitter, we warn ya
She lurks in a treehouse
In Burbank, California
Along with a nephew
He says spew, he's cheerful
When his aunt starts to rant
She gives him an earful
She's grumpy, He's happy
It's generation-gappy
Take a whirl with the squirrels
Skippy and Slappy
-Oh put a sock in it
-That's my aunt Slappy!

And with the early dawn moving right along,
I couldn't buy an eyeful of sleep.
And in the aching night under satellites,
I was not received.
Built with stolen parts,
A telephone in my heart,
Someone get me a priest,
To put my mind to bed.
This ringing in my head,
Is this a cure ,
Or is this a disease?
||
Like walking into a dream, so unlike what you've seen
So unsure but it seems, 'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here - so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway
||
I don't need to be a global citizen
Because I'm blessed by nationality
I'm member of a growing populace
We enforce our popularity
There are things that
Seem to pull us under
And there are things
That drag us down
But there's a power
And a vital presence
That's lurking all around
We've got the american Jesus
See him on the interstate
We've got the american Jesus
He helped build the
President's estate
I feel sorry
For the earth's population
'Cuz so few
Live in the you. S. A.
At least the foreigners
Can copy our morality
They can visit but they cannot stay
Only precious few
Can garner the prosperity
It makes us walk
With renewed confidence
We've got a place to go when we die
And the architect resides right here
We've got the american Jesus
Overwhelming millions every day
(Exercising his authority)
He's the farmers barren fields
The force the army wields
The expession in the faces
Of the starving millions
The power of the man
He's the fuel that drives the clan
He's the motive and conscience
Of the murderer
He's the preacher on T. V.
The false sincerity
The form letter that's written
By the big computers
He's the nuclear bombs
And the kids with no moms
And I'm fearful that
He's inside me
||
Long ago in a dusty village
Full of hunger, pain and strife
A man came forth with a vision of truth
And the way to a better life
He was convinced he had the answer
And he complelled people to follow along
But the hunger never vansihed
And the man was banished
And the village dried up and died
At a time when wise men peered
Through glass tubes toward the sky
The heavens changed in predictable ways
And one man was able to find
That he had thought he found the answer
And he was quick to write his revelation
But as they were scutinized
In his colleagues eyes
He soon became a mockery
Don't tell me the answer
I've got ideas too
But if you've got enough naivete
And you've got conviction
Then the answer is perfect for you
An urban sprawl sits choking on it's discharge
Overwhelmed by industry
Searching for a modern day savior from another place
Inclined toward charity
Everyone's begging for an answer
Without regard to validity
The searching never ends
It goes on and on for eternity
||
Six o'clock already
I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
||
Well east coast girls are hip
I really dig those styles they wear
And the southern girls with the way they talk
They knock me out when I'm down there
||
If everybody had an ocean
Across the you. S. A.
Then everybody'd be surfin'
Like Californi-a
You'd seem 'em wearing their baggies
Huarachi sandals too
A bushy bushy blonde hairdo
Surfin' you. S. A.
You'd catch 'em surfin' at Del Mar
Ventura County line
Santa Cruz and Trestle
Australia's Narabine
All over Manhattan
And down Doheny Way
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' you. S. A.
We'll all be planning that route
We're gonna take real soon
We're waxing down our surfboards
We can't wait for June
We'll all be gone for the summer
We're on surfari to stay
Tell the teacher we're surfin'
Surfin' you. S. A.
Haggerties and Swamies
Pacific Palisades
San Anofree and Sunset
Redondo Beach L. A.
All over La Jolla
At Waimia Bay
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' you. S. A.
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' you. S. A.
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' you. S. A.

You say stop and I say go go go, oh no.
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello hello

Chorus:
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
Its much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
Its as high as a mountain
And harder to climb
||
Oh, baby do you know what that's worth?
Oh, Heaven is a place on Earth.
They say in Heaven, love comes first
We'll make Heaven a place on Earth
Oh, Heaven is a place on Earth

Last night a little dancer
Came dancin' to my door
Last night a little angel
Came pumpin' on my floor
She said come baby
You got a license for love
And if it expires
Bring Hell from above because

In the midnight hour she cried "more, more, more"
With a rebel yell she cried "more, more, more"
In the midnight hour, babe "more, more, more"
With a rebel yell, "more, more, more"
More, more, more

She don't like slavery, she won't sit and beg
But when I'm tired and lonely she sees me to bed
What set you free and brought you to me, babe?
What set you free? I need you here by me, because

In the midnight hour, she cried "more, more, more"
With a rebel yell she cried "more, more, more"
In the midnight hour babe "more, more, more"
With a rebel yell "more, more, more"

He lives in his own heaven
Collects it to go from the seven eleven
Well, he's out all night to collect a fare
Just as long, just as long it don't mess up his hair

I walked the world to you, babe
A thousand miles for you
I dried your tears of pain
A million times to you

I'd sell my soul for you, babe
For money to burn for you
I'd give you all and have none, babe
Just to, just to, just to, just to, to have you here by me, because

In the midnight hour, she cried "more, more, more"
With a rebel yell she cried "more, more, more"
In the midnight hour babe "more, more, more"
With a rebel yell she cried "more, more, more"
"More, more, more"

Oh yeah, a little baby
She want more, more, more, more, more, more
Oh yeah, a little angel
She want more, more, more, more, more

Some folks like to get away,
Take a holiday from the neighborhood.
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood.
But I'm takin' a Greyhound on the Hudson River line.
I'm in a New York state of mind.
||
In a crooked little town, they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves... On the ground
||
Rejected... Since day one
My name is... Bastard son
I've been damned... So many times I've lost count!
Blue collar... Working man
Devises... Master plan
Bi-polar... With a mental side arm
||
I am Iron Man!
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?
||
Alright now!
Won't you listen?

I came from far
Beyond Your reality
The ocean of time
It's the odysee of mine
I am the narrator
And now I'll tell You
Where I've been
And what I saw
And how it ends
Welcome to the wasteland
In a world which is turning faster
Where I'm alone for a while
It's turning faster
Away from light straight to the dark
The march of time it has begun
I'm caught in an ancient dream so bright
And then the march of time begins
The man in black he waits
Behind this last task
It's full of pain
To sacrifice the only son
The legions of the lost
Wait in the old mine
They try to stop me
The battle it has begun
So I'm not afraid
To walk down to the wasteland
I'm so alone on my way
And I don't fear that dusty godforsaken path
Somewhere far beyond
Ref.:
Somewhere far beyond
The march of time it has begun
Somewhere far beyond your reality
And then the march of time begins
Look at my soul
And behind
There are some things
I've to hide from You
I'm following the black man
I'm losing control
And I don't care
What's happening to the boy
Welcome to the new world
One more step to the dark tower
And my whole body's in flames
I'm looking for Those healing things to be prepared
The march of time it has begun
I'm caught in a prisoner's dirty life
And then the march of time begins
The prisoner did bring the healing spell
The queen of shadows found herself in pain
And death brings answers to us all
What will I find
When the dark tower appears
Will it be the end
Or just a new quest after all
I am the narrator
And now I'll tell You
Where I'd been
And what I saw
And how it ends
(Solo)
Ref. (2x)
Look around and see
The world is turning fast
Faster day by day
Somewhere far beyond
I'll try to change it
If I can - Somewhere far beyond
There's only one chance
And it lies - Somewhere far beyond
Somewhere far beyond
The march of time it has begun
The march of time it has begun
||
I've seen the moon
And the first sunrise
I'll leave it to the memories
And kiss the wind goodbye
||
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
I like watchin' the puddles gather rain

[Verse:]
All the small things
True care truth brings
I'll take one lift
You're ride best trip
||
Color me your color, baby.
Color me your car
Color me your color, darling.
I know who you are
Come up off your color chart
I know where you're coming from

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.

Buffalo soldier, dreadlock rasta:
There was a buffalo soldier in the heart of america, 
Stolen from africa, brought to america, 
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival.

It's all the same, only the names will change
Every day it seems we're wasting away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night just to get back home
Chorus:
I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive
Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
And the people I meet always go their separate ways
Somet imes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone all you do is think
Chorus
I walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back
I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make it back
I been everywhere, still I'm standing tall
I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all
I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
I'm a cowboy, I got the night on my side
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive

Would you be content to see me crying
After all those little games you put me through
After all I've done for you you're lying
Wouldn't it be nice to tell the truth
||
Where have all the good men gone and where are all the gods?
Where's the street wise Hercules to fight the rising odds?
Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?
Late at night I toss and I turn and I dream of what I need
||
(Turn around) every now and then I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming round
(Turn around) every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears
(Turn around) every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by
(Turn around) every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes
||
I looked out this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away
||
You and me we were the pretenders
We let it all slip away
In the end what you don't surrender
Well the world just strips away
Girl, aint no kindness in the face of strangers
Aint gonna find no miracles here
Well you can wait on your blesses my darling
I got a deal for you right here
I aint looking for praise or pity
I aint coming round searching for a crutch
I just want someone to talk to
And a little of that human touch
Just a little of that human touch
||
[Verse 1]
Look into my eyes - you will see
What you mean to me
Search your heart, search your soul
And when you find me there, you'll search no more

[Chorus]
Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
You know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you

[Verse 2]
Look into your heart - you will find
There's nothin' there to hide
Take me as I am, take my life
I would give it all, I would sacrifice

[Chorus]
Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for
I can't help it, there's nothin' I want more
You know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you

[Bridge]
There's no love like your love
And no other could give more love
There's nowhere unless you're there
All the time, all the way, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
I can't help it there's nothin' I want more
Yeah, I would fight for you
I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you
Yeah, I'd die for you

[Outro]
You know it's true
Everything I do
Oh, I do it for you
||
Must be your skin that I'm sinkin in
Must be for real, cause now I can feel
I didn't mind
It's not my kind
Not my time to wonder why
Everything's gone white
And everything's grey
Now your here now your away
I don't want this
Remember that
I'll never forget where your at.
Don't let the days go by
Glycerine (repeat)
||
Dah pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show you,
So tell all the boys and girls.
Tell your brother, your sister
And mama too, cause they’re
About to go down
And you’ll know just what to do.
||
Every night in my dreams
I see you. I feel you.
That is how I know you go on.
||
Darling you gotta let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
If you say that you are mine
I'll be here til the end of time
So you got to let know
Should I stay or should I go?
||
I could take every fucking word she says
Throw it in her face
But would she even care
I still remember when she looked at me
That frown upon her face
Trying to be sincere
I gathered all those little things she said
Kept them close to me
Trying to make this real
This cloud will alway hover over me
I'm leaving you today
'cause now I see
||
Lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
You've put me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead (singing)
Come out of things unsaid, shoot an apple off my head (and a)
Trouble that can't be named, a tiger's waiting to be tamed (singing)
You are, you are
||
Lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
You've put me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead (singing)
Come out of things unsaid, shoot an apple off my head (and a)
Trouble that can't be named, a tiger's waiting to be tamed (singing)
You are, you are
||
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
||
Oh brother I can't, I can't get through
I've been trying hard to reach you 'cause I don't know what to do
Oh brother I can't believe it's true
I'm so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
Oh I wanna talk to you
||
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I read a note my grandma wrote back in nineteen twenty-three.
Grandpa kept it in his coat, and he showed it once to me. He said,
"Boy, you might not understand, but a long, long time ago,
Grandma's daddy didn't like me none, but I loved your Grandma so. "
||
A long December and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leaving
Oh the days go by so fast
||
It's not worth anything,
More than this at all.
I'll live as I choose,
Or I will not live at all.
||
I see the bad moon arising.
I see trouble on the way.
I see earthquakes and lightnin'.
I see bad times today.

Oh Susie Q,
Oh Susie Q,
Oh Susie Q, baby I love you, Susie Q.

Lisa:    Leave me out with the waste
This is not what I do
It's the wrong kind of place
To be thinking of you
It's the wrong time
For somebody new
It's a small crime
And I've got no excuse

Tell your children not to walk my way
Tell your children not to hear my words

Can you keep them in the dark for life
Can you hide them from the waiting world
Oh mother
Father
Gonna take your daughter out tonight
Gonna show her my world
Oh father
Not about to see your light
But if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's like
Till you're bleeding
Not about to see your light
And if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's
Mother
Tell your children to hold my hand
Tell your children not to understand
Oh mother
Father
Do you wanna bang heads with me
Do you wanna feel everything
Oh father
Not about to see your light
And if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's like
Till you're bleeding
Not about to see your light
And if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's
Yea
Not about to see your light
But if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's like
Till you're bleeding
Not about to see your light
And if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's like

Here's our version of root. We cover the song. I'm in a band out of austin called plain. -
P. H7
We forced under I look unto your home, because we gave our eyes but no one will yes I
Know the crime
To the cause I will be bored(born?)(2nd chorus- I will evolve but you won't) we are here
Into your eyes it's up inside we start to cry just because I will aver limit me and suffer live
Or would... Live
We judge by one, or linked by three and your holes enclose, we gave our eyes, but no one
Will yes I know because
And then I fuck the meaning and you won't find me and you won't find me and you won't
Turn away sucker(psycho) and though that means you won't find me and you won't find me
And you won't so I come from sucker and though that means you won't find me and you
Won't find me a you won't turn away sucker and though that means you won't find me, I'm
Into the big call and, and we, we go with Jesus in a bowl of germ
Some more I been fly.

Crack that whip
Give the past the slip
Step on a crack
Break your momma's back
When a problem comes along
You must whip it
Before the cream sits out too long
You must whip it
When something's going wrong
You must whip it

Jeden Tag sitz ich am Wannsee
Und ich hцare den Wellen zu.

Doch ich finde keine Ruh!
Diese eine Liebe wird nie zuende geh'n!
Wann werd ich sie wiedersehen?

A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a lovesong that he made
Finds a streetlight steps out of the shade
Says something like you and me babe how about it?

Another mission, the powers have called me away
Another time to carry the colors again
My motivation, an oath I've sworn to defend
To win the honor of coming back home again
No explanation will matter after we begin
Unlock the dark destroyer that's buried within
My true vocation, and now my unfortunate friend
You will discover a war you're unable to win
||
Day after day as I bodies slay
And the sun becomes dark in the sky
Everything's lost for this human race
And the dawn of a new age will rise
||
Life is a misery, don't know how it's come to be
Death, the epitome of all of our days
In the past we had no choice to hear or to be the voice
Close your eyes and visualise, the demon to arise
||
Music by dream theater
Lyrics by john myung

[H:]
"Close your eyes and begin to relax. Take a deep breath, and let it out
Slowly. Concentrate on your breathing. With each breath you become more
Relaxed. Imagine a brilliant white light above you, focusing on this light as
It flows through your body. Allow yourself to drift off as you fall deeper and
Deeper into a more relaxed state of mind. Now as I count backward from ten to
One, you will fill more peaceful, and calm. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. You
Will enter a safe place where nothing can harm you. Five. Four. Three. Two. If
At any time you need to came back, all you must do is open your eyes. One. "

I. Reflection
Cunning, Baffling, Powerful

She never really had a chance
On that fateful moonlit night
Sacrificed without a fight
A victim of her circumstance
||
Standing by the window
Eyes upon the moon
Hoping that the memory will leave her spirit soon
||
Life is like a hurricane, here in Duck Burg
Race cars, lasers, aeroplanes, it's a duck blur
Might solve a mystery, or rewrite history!
||
Just'a good ol' boys
Never meanin' no harm
Beats all you never saw
Been in trouble with the law
Since the day they was born
||
Sailin' away on the crest of a wave
It's like magic
Rollin' and ridin' and slippin' and slidin'
It's magic
And you, and your sweet desire
You took me higher and higher
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose
Making believe this is what you conceived
From your worst day
Moving in line then you look back in time
To your first day
And you, and your sweet desire
You took me higher and higher
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose
Takin' a dive 'cos you can't halt the slide 
floating downstream
So let her go Don't start spoiling the show
It's a bad dream
And you, and your sweet desire
You took me higher and higher
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose
||
Yesterday you came to lift me up
As light as straw and brittle as a bird
Today I weigh less than a shadow on the wall
Just one more whisper of a voice unheard
||
Blue moon, blue moon, blue moon,
Keep shining bright.
Blue moon, keep on shining bright,
You're gonna bring me back my baby tonight,
Blue moon, keep shining bright.
||
Who can tell me if we have heaven,
who can say the way it should be;
Moonlight holly, the Sappho Comet,
Angel's tears below a tree.
||
Who can say where the road goes,
Where the day flows?
Only time...
||
Let me sail, let me sail: let the Orinoco Flow.
Let me reach, let me beach on the shores of Tripoli
Let me sail, let me sail: let me crash upon your shore
Let me reach, let me beach far beyond the Yellow Sea
||
Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would you feel the same
If I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven...
||
When lights goes down,
I see no reason for you to cry,
We've been through this before in every time,
In every season, God knows I've tried
So please don't ask for more
Can't you see it in my eyes
That this might be our last goodbye
||
Lithium, don't want to lock me up inside.
Lithium, don't want to forget how it feels without...
Lithium, I want to stay in love with my sorrow.
Oh, but God, I want to let it go.

Wake up, little Susie, wake up
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
Weve both been sound asleep
Wake up, little Susie and weep
The movies over, its four oclock
And were in trouble deep
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie, well
What are we gonna tell your mama
What are we gonna tell your pa
What are we gonna tell our friends
When they say ooh-la-la
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie
**Well I told your mama that youd be in by ten
Well Susie baby looks like we goofed agai-ain
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie
We gotta go home
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
The movie wasnt so hot
It didn't have much of a plot
We fell asleep, our goose is cooked
Our reputation is shot
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie, well
What are we gonna tell your mama
What are we gonna tell your pa
What are we gonna tell our friends
When they say ooh-la-la
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie

I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
||
[Verse:]
Hello
I've waited here for you
Everlong
||
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
||
Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wond'ring in the night what were the chances
We'd be sharing love before the night was through
||
Blame it all on my roots
I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know
The last one to show
I was the last one
You thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise
And the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you
Said honey we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain
||
Well I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has got a body like you
||
Winding your way down on Baker Street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day, you'll drink the night away
And forget about everything.
||
Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
||
Too many things I've never spoken
I'm not feeling fine
I never told you what to do
I never made you a promise that you could hold me to
That'll be the day you see me crying
||
And I'd give up forever to touch you,
Cause I know that you feel me somehow.
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be,
And I don't want to go home right now.
||
Driving that train, high on cocaine,
Casey jones is ready, watch your speed.
Trouble ahead, trouble behind,
And you know that notion just crossed my mind.
||
Just like jack the ripper, just like mojo hand,
Just like billy sunday, in a shotgun ragtime band,
Just like new york city, just like jerico,
Pace the halls and climb the walls and get out when they blow.
||
I'm having trouble trying to sleep
I'm counting sheep but running out
As time ticks by
And still I try
No rest for crosstops in my mind
On my own... here we go
My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own... here we go
My mind is set on overdrive
The clock is laughing in my face
A crooked spine
My sense dulled
Passed the point of delerium
On my own... here we go
My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own... here we go
||
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
||
When you were young
And your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live
You know you did
You know you did
You know you did
But if this ever changin
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die
What does it matter to ya
When ya got a job to do
Ya got to do it well
You got to give the other fella hell
You used to say live and let live
You know you did
You know you did
You know you did
But if this ever changin
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die
||
You in the jungle baby.
Wake up. Time to dieeee!
||
Woo-who, yee-who
Woo-who, yee-who
Woo-who, yee-who
Woo-who, yee-who
||
I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh I hope that it won't end though
Alone
||
Bittida en morgon innan solen upprann
Bergatroliet friade till fager ungersven
Innan foglarna bцrjade sjunga
Hon hade en falskeliger tunga
||
I've been looking so long for you
Now you won't get away from my grasp.
You've been living so long in hiding
In hiding behind that false mask.
And you know and I know that
You ain't got long now to last.
Your looks and your feelings
Are just the remains of your past.
||
You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand, there's no turning back
||
I hope this old train breaks down
Then I could take a walk around
And, see what there is to see
And time is just a melody
All the people in the street
Walk as fast as their feet can take them
I just roam through town
And though my windows got a view
The frame I'm looking through
Seems to have no concern for me now
So for now
||
There are children standing here,
Arms outstretched into the sky,
Tears drying on their face.
He has been here.
Brothers lie in shallow graves.
Fathers lost without a trace.
A nation blind to their disgrace,
Since he's been here.
||
Rain, rain on my face
It hasn't stopped raining for days
My world is a flood
Slowly I become one with the mud
||
You took your coat off and stood in the rain,
You're always crazy like that.
And I watched from my window,
Always felt I was outside looking in on you.
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair,
You were fashionably sensitive
But too cool to care.
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather.
||
You are so beautiful to me
You are so beautiful to me
Can't you see
Your everything I hoped for
Your everything I need
You are so beautiful to me

Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today...

When the blood dries in my veins and my
Heart feels no more pain
I know, I'll be on my way,
To heavens door,

I know when I'm not,
I'll be hoping I don't drop,
To a place where I will rise, like before,

I know when I'm not,
I'll be hoping I don't drop,
To a place where I will rise, like before,

I can feel, something happening
That I've never felt before
Hopeless dreaming will start,
Dragging me away from heavens door

I can feel, something happening
That I've never felt before
Hopeless dreaming will start,
Dragging me away from heavens door

When my mind stops thinking,
My eyes stop blinking,
I hope
Somebody's there.

And my heart stops beating
And my lungs stop breathing
In air,
I hope somebody cares,

When the blood dries in my veins and my
Heart feels no more pain
I know, I'll be on my way,
To heavens door,

I know when I'm not,
I'll be hoping I don't drop,
To a place where I will rise, like before,

I know when I'm not,
I'll be hoping I don't drop,
To a place where I will rise, like before,

I can feel, something happening
That I've never felt before
Hopeless dreams will start,
Dragging me away from heavens door

When my mind stops thinking,
My eyes stop blinking,
I hope
Somebody's there.

And my heart stops beating
And my lungs stop breathing
In air,
I hope somebody cares,

When my mind stops thinking
My eyes stop blinking
I know
At the end.

||
Lying beside you, here in the dark
Feeling your heart beat with mine
Softly you whisper, you're so sincere
How could our love be so blind
We sailed on together
We drifted apart
And here you are by my side
||
Watching the people get lairy
It's not very pretty I tell thee
Walking through town is quite scary
Its not very sensible either
A friend of a friend he got beaten
He looked the wrong way at a policeman
Would never of happened to Smeaton
An old leodensian
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I tried to get to my taxi
The man in a tracksuit attacks me
He said that he saw it before me
And wants to get things a bit gory
Girls scrabble round with no clothes on
To borrow a pound for a condom
If it wasn't for chip fat they'd be frozen
They're not very sensible
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
And if there's anybody left in here
That doesn't want to be out there
Watching the people get lairy
It's not very pretty I tell thee
Walking through town is quite scary
It's not very sensible
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
And if there's anybody left in here
That doesn't want to be out there
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
||
There's a pain within
That I can't define
There's an empty space
Where my love used to shine
||
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did,
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far
||
Ah-ah-ahhhh-ah, ah-ah-ahhh-ah
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow
Hammer of the gods
We'll drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde, sing an' cry
Valhalla, I am coming
On we sweep-we with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore
||
I wish that I could fly
Into the sky
So very high
Just like a dragonfly
||
[Javert]
There, out in the darkness
A fugitive running
Fallen from God
Fallen from grace
God be my witness
I never shall yield
Till we come face to face
Till we come face to face
||
[Verse 1]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be,
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface.
Don't know what you're expecting of me,
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes.
[Pre-Chorus]
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertone)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you!
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertone)
||
Would you be satisfied
If I told you lies?
Would it make it right?
No, I won't justify
Your masquerade - like cries
I know it will go by
||
Would you love a monsterman
Could you understand beauty of the beast
||
Soy un hombre muy honrado,
Que me gusta lo mejor
Las mujeres no me faltan,
Ni el dinero, ni el amor

Jineteando en mi caballo
Por la sierra yo me voy
Las estrellas y la luna
Ellas me dicen donde voy

Ay, ay, ay, ay,
Ay, ay mi amor
Ay, mi morena,
De mi corazón

Me gusta tocar guitarra
Me gusta cantar el son
El mariachi me acompaña
Cuando canto mi canción

Me gusta tomar mis copas
Aguardiente es lo mejor
Tambien el tequila blanco
Con su sal le da sabor

Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay mi amor
Ay mi morena,
De mi corazón

Me gusta tocar guitarra
Me gusta cantar el son
El mariachi me acompaña
Cuando canto mi canción

Me gusta tomar mis copas
Aguardiente es lo mejor
Tambien el tequila blanco
Con su sal le da sabor

Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay mi amor
Ay, mi morena
De mi corazón

Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay mi amor
Ay mi morena,
De mi corazón

I see trees of green........ Red roses too

And I think to myself.... What a wonderful world.

I see skies of blue..... Clouds of white
Bright blessed days.... Dark sacred nights

The colors of a rainbow..... So pretty.. In the sky

They'll learn much more..... Than I'll never know

Tu vestita di fiori
O di fari in citt
Con la nebbia o I colori
Cogliere le rose a piedi nudi e poi
Con la sciarpa stretta al collo bianca come mai
Ma... Aha ah aha ah ah
Eri bella, bella
Comunque bella.
Quando l'arcobaleno
Era in fondo ai tuoi occhi
Quando sotto al tuo seno
L'ira avvelenava il cuore tuo perch
Tu vedevi un'altra donna avvicinarsi a me
Prima ancora che io capissi e riscegliessi te
Tu... Aha ah aha ah ah
Eri bella, bella
Comunque bella...
Aaah ah ah aha...
Anche quando un mattino tornasti vestita di pioggia
Con lo sguardo stravolto da una notte d'amore
"Siediti qui
Non ti chiedo perdono perch tu sei un uomo".
Coi capelli bagnati - so che capirai
Con quei segni sul viso - mi spiace da morire sai
Coi tuoi occhi arrossati
Mentre tu mentivi e mi dicevi che
Ancora pi di prima tu amavi me
Tu... Uhu uh uhu uh uh
Eri bella, bella
Comunque bella
Aha ah aha ah aha.

Hangin' round downtown
By myself
And I had so much time
To sit and think
About myself
And then there she was
Like double cherry pie
Yeah there she was
Like disco superfly
I smell s** and
Candy here
Who's that lounging
In my chair
Who's that casting
Devious stares
In my direction
Mama this surely
Is a dream
||
She says it's cold outside and she hands me my raincoat
Shes always worried about things like that
She says it's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault
And she only sleeps when it's raining
And she screams and her voice is straining
(chorus)
She says baby
Its 3am I must be lonely
When she says baby
Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
Says the rains gonna wash away I believe it
||
You take a mortal man,
And put him in control
Watch him become a god,
Watch peoples heads a'roll
A'roll...

[Verse 1]
My mother was a witch, she was burned alive
Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace

[Pre-Chorus]
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice
Got to see them make them pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time

[Chorus]
Am I evil? Yes I am !!!
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am !!!

[Verse 2]
As I watched my mother die, I lost my head
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread
Taking no chances, you come with me
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free

[Pre-Chorus]
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice
Got to see them make them pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time

[Chorus]
Am I evil? Yes I am !!!
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am !

[Guitar Bridge]

[Verse 3]
On with the action now, I'll strip your pride
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you writhe
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat
Like a devil dancin' before you, smells so sweet

[Chorus]
Am I evil? Yes I am !!!
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am !!!

[Verse 4]
I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire
You can come with me, sweet desire
My face is long forgot, my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore, take me home

[Chorus]
Am I evil? Yes I am !!!
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am !!!

Go !

[Guitar Solo & Guitar Bridge]

[Verse 5]
My soul is longing for, await my heir
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself
My face is long forgot, my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore, take me home

[Chorus]
Am I evil? Yes I am !!!
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am !!!
Am I evil? Yes, I fuckin', am !!!
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am, yeah !!!

Say your prayers little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I Tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never never land
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of snow white
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never never land
Now I lay me down to sleep (Now I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the lord my soul to keep (Pray the lord my soul to keep)
If I die before I wake (If I die before I wake)
Pray the lord my soul to take (Pray the lord my soul to take)
Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed,
In your closet, in your head
Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never land
||
[Verse 1]
Life, it seems will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free !!!

[Verse 2]
Things are not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this Hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me but now he's gone !!!

[Guitar Bridge]

[Bridge]
No one but me can save myself
But it's too late
Now I can't think
Think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm
Now I will just say Goodbye ...
Goodbye !!!
||
Wish I may, wish I might
Have this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold, dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?
||
And now I wait my whole lifetime
For you
And now I wait my whole lifetime
For you
||
When a man lies, he murders some part of the world.
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives.
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer.
Cannot the Kingdom of Salvation take me home?
||
... And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need
... And with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave
Rover, wanderer
Nomad, Vagabond
Call me what you will
But I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I may roam
Where I lay my head is home
... And the earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one
... And my ties are severed clean
The less I have the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign
Rover, wanderer
Nomad, Vagabond
Call me what you will
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere
Anywhere I may roam
Where I lay my head is home
But i'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind
And I'll take my find anywhere
Anywhere I may roam
Where I lay my head is home
Carved upon my stone
My body lie, but still I roam
Wherever I may roam
||
[1st verse]
She was more like beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurkin'in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
||
Mr. Phelps, Mr. Phelps
Mr. Phelps, Mr. Phelps
||
Where it began
I can't begin to knowin'
But then I know it's growing strong
||
I wanna live with a cinnamon girl
I could be happy the rest of my life
With a cinnamon girl
A dreamer of pictures
||
He'd asked her to come to California where it's even warmer than in Texas
He tells her twice to lose her glasses
As they pass the masses on the streets
Jackie she sees what a lady is not supposed to see
Jackie she starts to scream and gets up on her knees
||
I hurt myself today,
To see if I'd still feel.
I focus on the pain,
The only thing that's real.
The needle tears a hole,
The old familiar sting;
Try to kill it all away,
But I remember everything.
||
You're keeping in step
In the line
Got your chin held high and you feel just fine
Because you do
What you're told
But inside your heart it is black and it's hollow and it's cold
||
What else should I be
All apologies
What else could I say
Everyone is gay
What else could I write
I don't have the right
What else should I be
All apologies

She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your Heart-Shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn back (Alt: ... When you turn black)

Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's overbored and self-assured
Oh, no, I know a dirty word
||
Underneath the bridge
The tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped
Have all become my pets
And I'm living off of grass
And the drippings from the ceiling
But it's ok to eat fish
Cause they don't have any feelings

Breathe ever so soft,
We wouldn't wanna break the eggs as we walk.
Never alone, cautious, afraid,
I hear the voice of reason on the P. A.

Hold up... Hold on... Don't be scared,
You'll never change what's been and gone.
May your smile... Shine on...
Don't be scared,
Your destiny may keep you warm.

Day after day your home life's a wreck
The powers that be just
Breathe down your neck
You get no respect
You get no relief
You gotta speak up
And yell out your piece
So back off your rules
Back off your jive
Cause I'm sick of not living
To stay alive
Leave me alone
I'm not asking a lot
I just don't want to be controlled
That's all I want
All I want
How many times is it gonna take
Till someone around you hears what you say
You've tried being cool
You feel like a lie
You've played by their rules
Now it's their turn to try
So back off your rules
Back off your jive
Cause I'm sick of not living
To stay alive
Leave me alone
I'm not asking a lot
I just don't want to be controlled
That's all I want
All I want
I said it before
I'll say it again
If you could just listen
Then it might make sense
||
I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
||
Screaming at the window
Watch me die another day
Hopeless situation
Endless price I have to pay
||
Yesterday has been and gone
Tommorow will I find the sun
Or will it rain
Everybody's having fun
Except me I'm the lonely one
I live in shame

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands
Love Is A Battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searchin' our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love Is A Battlefield
||
Lost in a dream - I don't know which way to go
(Let me say that) if you are all that you seem, then, baby, I'm moving way too slow
||
You guys ready...
Alone... Listless... Breakfast table in an otherwise empty room
Young girl... Violence... Center of her own attention
Mother reads aloud, child tries to understand it
Tries to make her proud
The shades go down, it's in her head
Painted room... Can't deny there's something wrong...
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me...
She holds the hand that holds her down
She will... Rise above...
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to be
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me...
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to be
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me...
The shades go down
The shades go down
The shades go, go, go...

I've heard it all before
Could hear it all a thousand times more
Playing with me all the time
No one feels the same
And sanity is all a game
Locked up deep inside my mind
||
Past the point of no return, no backward glances
The games we've played, till now are at an end
Past all thought of if or when, no use resisting
Abandon thought and let the dream descend
||
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord
||
Into the distance, a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
Flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone, my senses reel
Fatal attraction that's holding me fast
Now, can't escape this irresistible grasp
Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted; just an earth-bound misfit, I
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty, and turned to stone
A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition: grounded - determined to try
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted; just an earth-bound misfit, I
[Bridge:]
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer,
My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air,
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night
There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation - a state of bliss
Can't keep my mind from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I
||
I've got a little black book with my poems in
I've got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in
I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
Got those swollen hand blues.
Got thirteen channels of shit on the T. V. To choose from
I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
I've got amazing powers of observation
And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There'll be nobody home
I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm
And I've got the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
I've got wild staring eyes
I've got a strong urge to fly
But I've got nowhere to fly to
Ooooh Babe when I pick up the phone
There's still nobody home
I've got a pair of Gohills boots
And I've got fading roots.
||
Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn
Remember how she said that
We would meet again
Some sunny day
Vera! Vera!
What has become of you
Does anybody else in here
Feel the way I do?
||
I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause
||
There is no political solution
To our troubled evolution
Have no faith in constitution
There is no bloody revolution
||
Well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you, (who?)
If I get drunk, (If I get drunk, ) well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you, (yeah) Yes! 
And if I haver, (when I hav... What does haver mean, ) 
Yeah I know I'm gonna be I'm gonna be the man who's havering to you, (It's on 'ere)
||
We skipped the light fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kinda seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
And the waiter brought a tray
||
I love the way you look at me
I feel the pain you place inside
Lock me up inside ya dirty cage
While I'm alone inside my mind
||
Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper light on his feet
A young fighter screaming with no time for doubt
With the pain and anger can't see a way out
It ain't much I'm asking I heard him say
Gotta find me a future move out of my way
I want it all I want it all I want it all and I want it now
I want it all I want it all I want it all and I want it now
||
[Verse:]
Buddy you're a boy make a big noise
Playin' in the street gonna be a big man some day
You got mud on yo' face
You big disgrace
Kickin' your can all over the place
||
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
||
Wenn sie Brust schwimmt ist das schцn
Dann kann ich in ihr Zentrum sehn
Nicht dass die Brust das Schцne wдare
Ich schwimm ihr einfach hinterher
Funkenstaub flieЯt aus der Mitte
Ein Feuerwerk springt aus dem Schritt
||
Sah ein Mдdchen ein Rцslein stehen
Blьhte dort in lichten Hцhen
Sprach sie ihren Liebsten an
Ob er es ihr steigen kann
||
Die Nacht цffnet ihren SchoЯ
Das Kind heiЯt Einsamkeit
Es ist kalt und regungslos
Ich weine leise in die Zeit
Ich weiЯ nicht wie du heiЯt
Doch ich weiЯ dass es dich gibt
Ich weiЯ dass irgendwann
Irgendwer mich liebt
||
Beat on the brat
Beat on the brat
Beat on the brat with a baseball bat
Oh yeah, oh yeah, uh-oh.
||
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
||
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more.
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more. (What you say?)
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more.
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more.

Psychic spies from China
Try to steal your mind's elation
Little girls from Sweden
Dream of silver screen quotations
And if you want these kind of dreams
It's Californication

[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t, I don’t believe it’s bad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever

[Verse 1]
I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I’ve got to take it on the otherside

Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I’ve got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t, I don’t believe it’s bad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever

[Verse 2]
Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I’m spillin' my guts
She wants to know am I still her slut
I’ve got to take it on the otherside

A scarlet starlet and she’s in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I’ve got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t, I don’t believe it’s bad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever

[Bridge]
Turn me on take me for a hard ride
Burn me out leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that it’s not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down and then it’s born again

[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t, I don’t believe it’s bad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever

How long I don’t, I don’t believe it’s sad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever
||
Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on
||
Sometimes I feel
Like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel
Like my only friend
Is the city I live in
The city of Angels
Lonely as I am
Together we cry
||
Ooh, Life is bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no I've said too much, I set it up.
||
We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
||
Risin' up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
||
Oh, a storm is threat'ning
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away
||
Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a mans soul and faith
And I was round when jesus christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
I stuck around st. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank
Held a generals rank
When the blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah
I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the gods they made
I shouted out,
Who killed the kennedys?
When after all
It was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reached bombay
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game
Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails
Just call me lucifer
Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, um yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, um mean it, get down
Woo, who
Oh yeah, get on down
Oh yeah
Oh yeah!
Tell me baby, what's my name
Tell me honey, can ya guess my name
Tell me baby, what's my name
I tell you one time, you're to blame
Ooo, who
Ooo, who
Ooo, who
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who
Oh, yeah
What's my name
Tell me, baby, what's my name
Tell me, sweetie, what's my name
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who
Oh, yeah
||
You come out at night
That's when the energy comes
And the dark side's light
And the vampires roam
You strut your rasta wear
And your suicide poem
And a cross from a faith that died
Before Jesus came
You're building a mystery
||
I believe the sun should never set upon an argument
I believe we place our happiness in other people's hands
I believe that junk food tastes so good because it's bad for you
I believe your parents did the best job they knew how to do
I believe that beauty magazines promote low self esteem
I believe I'm loved when I'm completely by myself alone
||
Time, it needs time
To win back your love again.
I will be there, I will be there.

Love, only love
Can bring back your love someday.
I will be there, I will be there.

Fight, babe, I'll fight
To win back your love again.
I will be there, I will be there.

Love, only love
Can break down the walls someday.
I will be there, I will be there.

If we'd go again
All the way from the start,
I would try to change
The things that killed our love.

Your pride has build a wall, so strong
That I can't get through.
Is there really no chance
To start once again?
I'm loving you.

Try, baby try
To trust in my love again.
I will be there, I will be there.

Love, our love
Just shouldn't be thrown away.
I will be there, I will be there.

If we'd go again
All the way from the start,
I would try to change
The things that killed our love.

Your pride has build a wall, so strong
That I can't get through.
Is there really no chance
To start once again?

If we'd go again
All the way from the start,
I would try to change
The things that killed our love.

Yes I've hurt your pride, and I know
What you've been through.
You should give me a chance
This can't be the end.

I'm still loving you.
I'm still loving you,
I need your love.
I'm still loving you.
Still loving you, baby...

Ladies up in here tonight

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
Como se llama, bonita, mi casa, su casa
Shakira, Shakira

The chance to get out on the town

To have a little fun and...

Oh, oh, oh totally crazy

We are the youth
We'll take your fascism away
We are the youth
Apologise for another day
We are the youth
And politicians are so sure
We are the youth
And we are knocking on death's door
Never knew we were living in a world
With a mind that could be so sure
Never knew we were living in a world
With a mind that could be so small
Never knew we were living in a world
And the world is an open court
Maybe we don't want to live in a world
Where innocence is so short
We'll make it up to you
In the year 2000 with...

Cuando el amor llega asi de esta manera
Uno no se da ni cuenta
El carutal reverdece
El guamachito florece
Y la soga se revienta

Since I was born they couldn't hold me down
Another misfit kid, another burned-out town
Never played by the rules I never really cared
My nasty reputation takes me everywhere
I look and see it's not only me
So many others have stood where I stand
We are the young so raise your hands
They call us problem child
We spend our lives on trial
We walk an endless mile
We are the youth gone wild
We stand and we won't fall
We're the one and one for all
The writing's on the wall
We are the youth gone wild
Boss screamin' in my ear about who I'm supposed to be
Getcha a 3-piece Wall Street smile and son you'll look just like me
I said "Hey man, there's something that you oughta know.
I tell ya Park Avenue leads to Skid Row."
I look and see it's not only me
We're standin' tall ain't never a doubt
We are the young, so shout it out
They call us problem child
We spend our lives on trial
We walk an endless mile
We are the youth gone wild
We stand and we won't fall
We're the one and one for all
The writing's on the wall
We are the youth gone wild
They call us problem child
We spend our lives on trial
We walk an endless mile
We are the youth gone wild
We stand and we won't fall
We're the one and one for all
The writing's on the wall
We are the youth gone wild
We are the youth gone wild

I'm everything you've wanted
I am the one who's haunting you
I am the eyes inside of you
Stare back at you

[Intro]
Despite the lies that you're making,
Your love is mine for the taking.
My love is, just waiting,
To turn your tears to roses.

[Verse 1]
Despite the lies that you're making,
Your love is mine for the taking.
My love is, just waiting,
To turn your tears to roses.
I will be the one that's gonna hold you,
I will be the one that you run to,
My love is
A burning, consuming fire.

[Chorus]
No, you'll never be alone!
When darkness comes, I'll light the night with stars,
Hear the whispers in the dark.
No, you'll never be alone!
When darkness comes, you know I'm never far,
Hear the whispers in the dark.
Whispers in the dark.

[Verse 2]
You feel so lonely and ragged,
You lay here broken and naked.
My love is, just waiting,
To clothe you in crimson roses.
I will be the one that's gonna find you,
I will be the one that's gonna guide you,
My love is
A burning, consuming fire.

[Chorus]
No, you'll never be alone!
When darkness comes, I'll light the night with stars,
Hear the whispers in the dark.
No, you'll never be alone!
When darkness comes, you know I'm never far,
Hear the whispers in the dark.
Whispers in the dark.

[Bridge]
No, you'll never be alone!
When darkness comes, I'll light the night with stars,
Hear the whispers in the dark.
No, you'll never be alone!
When darkness comes, you know I'm never far,
Hear the whispers in the dark.
Whispers in the dark.

[Outro]
Whispers in the dark, whispers in the dark, whispers in the dark.

We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
||
Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blowtorch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning
||
I'm goin' down to South Park
Gonna have myself a time.
||
Just like the white winged dove...
Sings a song...
Sounds like she's singing...
Whoo... Whoo... Whoo
Just like the white winged dove...
Sings a song...
Sounds like she's singing...
Ooo... Baby... Ooo... Said ooo

I don't drink coffee I take tea my dear
I like my toast done on one side
And you can hear it in my accent when I talk
I'm an Englishman in New York
||
I don't practice Santeria,
I ain't got no crystal ball,
Well I had a million dollars but I,
I'd spend it all,
If I could find that heina and that sancho that she's found,
Well I'd pop a cap in sancho and I'd slap her down.
||
Dein Scheitel ist von Kupfer,
Ein Kastanienbaum, der brennt,
Glüht so heiß nicht wie dein Atem.
Feuer heißt dein Element,
Und auf deinen weißen Schultern
Schmilzt das Kupfer in der Glut.
Aus dem Innersten der Erde
Stammt dein Name und dein Blut.
||
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in
||
Life is a waterfall
We're one in the river
And one again after the fall
||
Why don't you ask the kids at Tiananmen Square,
Was fashion reason why they were there?
They disguise it,
Hypnotize it,
Television made you buy it.
||
Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you
Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature
Everybody wants to rule the world
||
Im your only friend
Im not your only friend
But Im a little glowing friend
But really Im not actually your friend
But I am
||
In my prison cell I think these words
I was careless
I can see that now
I must be silent
Must contain my secret smile
I want to tell you
You my mirror
You my iron bars
||
I can't escape this hell,
So many times I've tried,
But I'm still caged inside.
Somebody get me through this nightmare,
I can't control myself!
||
She's a good girl, loves her mama
Loves Jesus and America too
She's a good girl, crazy 'bout Elvis
Loves horses and her boyfriend too
||
These tears I've cried
I've cried 1000 oceans
And if it seems
I'm floating in the darkness
Well, I can't believe that I would keep
Keep you from flying
And I would cry 1000 more
If that's what it takes
To sail you home
Sail you home
Sail you home
||
Voca me benedictum!
Sana meam animam!
||
The heart is a bloom
Shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room
No space to rent in this town
||
One man come in the name of love
One man come and go
One man come, he to justify
One man to overthrow
||
My love she throws me like a rubber ball
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
She won't catch me or break my fall
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this I'm a rain cloud
You know she wants dry kind of love
Oh oh oh, the sweetest thing
||
Ordinary silence and insane thoughts
Mistdries treath Inside of hiding places
You can't find rest amongst the homeless ones
They scared of death it comes tonight
Compressed teeth trembling parts of body
An unknown shape disappears in the dark
Total manifestation of human strength
Dreadful screams through the night
Amusement or simple insanity one knows
Common man kills homeless pnes
Tight rope on weak wrist and ankle
There is no chance to survive
Professional anatomy on unprotected ones.
It is a meaning of life someone
Pierced skin by scalpel and knife
If you wanna avoid your nightmares
Don't make friend with the sleep bririger
To kill someone who has not anything
Bigger cancer than fuckin christianity
View of turned inside out bowels
Satisfaction that no one can stop
Intestines all around the ground
The killer was the winner of this fight.
||
Owwww!
I get up, and nothin' gets me down
You got it tough, I've seen the toughest around
And I know, baby, just how you feel
You got to roll with the punches and get to what's real
Ah, can't ya see me standin' here
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Ah, can't ya see what I mean?
Ah, might as well jump. Jump!
Might as well jump
Go ahead an' jump. Jump!
Go ahead and jump
Ow-oh! Hey, you! Who said that? Baby, how you been?
You say you don't know, you won't know until you begin
So can't ya see me standing here
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Ah, can't ya see what I mean?
Ah, might as well jump. Jump!
Go ahead and jump
Might as well jump. Jump!
Go ahead and jump
Jump!
(Guitar Solo)
Might as well jump. Jump!
Go ahead and jump
Get it in, jump. Jump!
Go ahead and jump
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

Don't wanna wait til tomorrow,
Why put it off another day?
One more walk through problems,
Built up, and stand in our way, ah
One step ahead, one step behind me
Now you gotta run to get even
Make future plans, don't dream about yesterday, hey
C'mon turn, turn this thing around
Right now, hey
It's your tomorrow
Right now,
C'mon, it's everything
Right now,
Catch a magic moment, do it
Right here and now
It means everything
Miss the beat, you lose the rhythm,
And nothing falls into place, no
Only missed by a fraction,
Slipped a little off your pace, oh,
The more things you get, the more you want,
Just trade in one for the other,
Workin so hard, to make it easier, whoa,
Got to turn, c'mon turn this thing around
Right now, hey
It's your tomorrow
Right now,
C'mon, it's everything
Right now,
Catch that magic moment, do it
Right here and now
It means everything
It's enlightened me, right now
What are you waitin for
Oh, yeah, right now
(solo)
Right now, hey
It's your tomorrow
Right now,
C'mon, it's everything
Right now,
Catch that magic moment, and do it right,
Right now
Right now, oh, right now
It's what's happening?
Right here and now
Right now
It's right now
Oh,
Tell me, what are you waiting for
Turn this thing around
||
Hey, where did we go
Days when the rains came?
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game,
Laughing and a-running, hey, hey,
Skipping and a-jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping
And you, my brown-eyed girl,
||
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
||
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round 'yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in Heavenly peace
Sleep in Heavenly peace
||
Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony this life...
Trying to make ends meet, you're a slave to the money then you die.
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down...
You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah.

Hip, hip
Hip, hip
Hip, hip
Hip, hip

When you're on a holiday
You can't find the words to say
All the things that come to you
And I want to feel it too

On an island in the sun
We'll be playin' and havin' fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain

Hip, hip
Hip, hip

When you're on a golden sea
You don't need no memory
Just a place to call your own
As we drift into the zone

On an island in the sun
We'll be playin' and havin' fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain

We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel that anymore

Hip, hip
Hip, hip

And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain

We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel that anymore

Hip, hip
(Hip, hip) we'll never feel that anymore
Hip, hip
No, no (hip, hip)
(Hip, hip) we'll never feel that anymore
Hip, hip
No, no (hip, hip)
No, no (hip, hip)

When I look in the mirror, I can't believe what I see
Tell me, who's that funky dude, staring back at me?
Broken, beaten down can't even get around
Without an old-man cane, I fall and hit the ground
Shivering in the cold, I'm bitter and alone
||
No, I don't know where I'm going
But, I sure know where I've been
Hanging on the promises
In songs of yesterday
An' I've made up my mind,
I ain't wasting no more time
Here I go again
Here I go again

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.

And the dreams that you dare to dream,

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Anyway, I can try anything it's the same circle that leads to nowhere and I'm tired now.
Anyway, I've lost my face, my dignity, my look, everything is gone and I'm tired now.
But don't be scared, I found a good job and I go to work every day on my old bicycle you loved.
I am pilling up some unread books under my bed and I really think i'll never read again.
No concentration, just a white disorder everywhere around me, you know I'm so tired now.
Don't worry I often go to dinners and parties with some old friends who care for me, take me back home and stay.
Monochrome floors, monochrome walls, only abscence near me, nothing but silence around me.
Monochrome flat, monochrome life, only abscence near me, nothing but silence around me.
Sometimes I search an event or something to remind me, but I've really got nothing in mind.
Sometimes I open the windows and listen people walking in the down streets. There is a life out there.
But don't be scared, I found a good job and I go to work every day on my old bicycle you loved.

When I'm asleep in Cascade Street
When I'm asleep in Cascade Street
I don't, I don't
See anything
||
Looking from a window above it's like a story of love
Can you hear me
Came back only yesterday I'm moving further away
Want you near me
||
Misunderstood, I'll bet,
And you will ask me to answer
What I can't know.
It's safe to say I wasn't with you then,
And it is hard to tell if I am now.
It is hard to tell if I am now.

The scientist tracked the wild
Beast through the jungle
And straight to your door.
You shot it dead, and you took
Its head and put it high upon your wall.
With a head upon your wall.

In your article, how did you put it?
You had me 'round your finger, did you?
Microphone, sick spit on it,
Make me feel no shame for a moment
Yesterday, yesterday never was.
Yesterday never was.

Yesterday, never.

I cast my pearls before the swine
Sealed and delivered
Then I drink your toast of wine
Though it's bitter sweet
I'm eating from you hand so neat
Pennies from heaven
You say you give
You say you love
But yet you live
Judas... Judas
Sightseeing through the lights
And shades of you mighty colonnades
No I got the picture
Of the beauty and the beast
I am the lamb... You are the priest
To crucify me
You say you give
You say you love
But yet you live
Judas... Judas
To make a living... Makes no difference
Friends, you are what you do
Some are false and some are true
You haven't got a clue
I'd rather reign in hell some said
Than serve in heaven
You say you give
You say you love
But yet you live
Judas... Judas

The earth is crumbling, the end is near
No one's listening, I'm filled with fear
Hear the warning, in the prophet's word
Day by day, we're destroying this world
No more water
No more blue skies
No one cares, no one tries
To save what we once had
World at war (a world at war)
Rich and poor (rich and poor)
Burn in hell (burn in hell)
Hear dooms days bells (dooms days bells)
Ringing loud (ringing loud)
I see black clouds
We are making lucifer so proud
World at war (a world at war)
Rich and poor (rich and poor)
Burn in hell (burn in hell)
Hear dooms days bells (dooms days bells)
Ringing loud (ringing loud)
I see black clouds
We are making lucifer so proud
Blind leading the blind
No one sees the seventh sign
We're left behind
There's no more hope, the day has come
What we have done, can't be undone
Too many years, we've lived in sin
We know for sure, the beast will win
Fight fire with fire, to start to run
Don't trust a liar, like we have done
We've lost the battle to the evil one
Blind leading the blind
No one sees the seventh sign
We're left behind.

I been up, I been down.
Take my word, my way around.
I ain't askin' for much.
I said, Lord, take me downtown,
I'm just lookin' for some tush.
